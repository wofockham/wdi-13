The Fortune Teller

Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

Store the following into variables: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
Output your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."

  ", and married to " + partnerName + " with " + numChildren + " kids";

console.log(biography);
